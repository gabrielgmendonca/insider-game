# Insider - Game Rules

**Insider** is a social deduction party game by [Oink Games](https://oinkgames.com/en/games/analog/insider/).

| Players | Time | Age |
|---------|------|-----|
| 4-8     | 15 min | 9+ |

## Overview

Insider combines a quiz game with hidden roles. Players must guess a secret word by asking yes/no questions to the Master within a time limit. The twist: one player (the Insider) secretly knows the answer and tries to guide others toward it without being discovered.

## Roles

| Role | Knows the Word | Goal |
|------|----------------|------|
| **Master** | Yes | Answer questions honestly. Help identify the Insider. |
| **Insider** | Yes | Guide others to the answer without being discovered. |
| **Commons** | No | Guess the word and identify the Insider. |

## Setup

1. Collect role tiles equal to the number of players (always include Master and Insider tiles)
2. Shuffle and deal one role tile to each player face-down
3. Players secretly look at their role
4. The Master reveals their role publicly; all other players keep their roles hidden
5. Prepare the theme/word cards as a deck

## Gameplay

### Phase 1: Word Reveal

1. All players close their eyes
2. The Master draws a card and looks at the secret word
3. The Master asks the Insider to open their eyes and shows them the word
4. The Insider closes their eyes
5. The Master announces "Everyone open your eyes"

### Phase 2: Question Time (5 minutes)

1. The Master starts the sand timer
2. Commons and the Insider ask yes/no questions to deduce the secret word
3. The Master can only answer:
   - **"Yes"**
   - **"No"**
   - **"I don't know"**
4. There is no limit to the number of questions
5. Any player (except the Master) can attempt to guess the word at any time
6. **If time runs out without a correct guess, everyone loses** (except the Insider wins)

### Phase 3: Discussion

When the word is correctly guessed:

1. Flip the sand timer to start discussion time
2. Players discuss who they think the Insider is
3. Analyze: Who asked suspiciously helpful questions? Who seemed to guide the guessing?

### Phase 4: Voting

1. **Initial Vote (optional):** Players raise hands if they believe the person who guessed correctly is the Insider. If majority agrees, that player reveals their role.
2. **Final Vote:** All players simultaneously point to who they think is the Insider. The player with the most votes is accused.

## Winning

| Condition | Winner |
|-----------|--------|
| Word guessed AND Insider correctly identified | **Commons & Master win** |
| Word guessed BUT Insider NOT identified | **Insider wins** |
| Time runs out, word not guessed | **Insider wins** |

## Tips

- **For the Insider:** Ask questions that subtly guide others without being obvious. Too helpful = suspicious!
- **For Commons:** Pay attention to question patterns. Who seemed to know more than they should?
- **For the Master:** Answer consistently and observe player behavior for the voting phase.

## Variant: No Insider

In some versions, one role tile is placed face-down in the center of the table. This means there might not be an Insider among the players at all, adding an extra layer of doubt!

## Variant: Insider Black

An advanced version featuring:
- More difficult theme cards
- 3-minute timer (instead of 5)
- **Follower** role: Teams up with the Insider (for 6+ players)
- Additional "black rules" for experienced players
